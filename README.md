# Alejandro Salazar – Security Lab Portfolio

Welcome to my **Security Lab Portfolio**.
This repository contains hands-on cybersecurity labs aligned with **SOC Analyst, Security Analyst, and Blue Team roles**.

These labs demonstrate practical experience in:

* Security monitoring
* Threat detection and investigation
* Network reconnaissance
* Vulnerability assessment
* Threat hunting using SIEM tools

This portfolio reflects my transition from **enterprise IT support into cybersecurity**, combining 6+ years of IT experience with practical security investigations.

This lab simulates a basic **SOC monitoring environment** where security logs are generated on a Windows host, analyzed in Splunk, and investigated using threat hunting techniques. Kali Linux is used to perform reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and simulated attack activity.
